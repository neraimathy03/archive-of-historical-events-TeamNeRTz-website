<p>The Norman Conquest of England in 1066 was a transformative event in 
English history, beginning with the death of King Edward the Confessor, who left 
no direct heir, and leading to a fierce battle for the throne. Harold Godwinson, 
a powerful English noble, was crowned king but faced immediate challenges from 
rival claimants, including William, Duke of Normandy, and Harald Hardrada, King 
of Norway. In September 1066, Harald Hardrada invaded northern England but was 
decisively defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Shortly after, 
William launched his invasion, landing in southern England on September 28. The 
pivotal moment came on October 14, 1066, at the Battle of Hastings, where 
William's forces defeated Harold's army, leading to Harold's death and securing 
William's claim to the English throne. William's victory marked the beginning of 
profound changes in England's governance, culture, and social structure, as 
Norman rule introduced new legal frameworks, feudal practices, and linguistic 
influences that reshaped the country's medieval landscape.<br>  <br>
The roots of the conquest can be traced back to the death of King 
Edward the Confessor in January 1066. Edward died without a direct heir, leading 
to a succession crisis. Several claimants vied for the throne, including Harold 
Godwinson, the powerful Earl of Wessex, William, Duke of Normandy, and Harald 
Hardrada, the King of Norway.<br>  <br>
In September 1066, Harald Hardrada, with support from Harold's 
estranged brother Tostig, invaded northern England. They initially achieved 
success but were ultimately defeated by Harold Godwinson's forces at the Battle 
of Stamford Bridge on September 25. This victory, however, left Harold's army 
exhausted and weakened. <br>  <br>
Shortly after this battle, William of Normandy launched his invasion. On 
September 28, 1066, William and his fleet landed at Pevensey on the southern 
coast of England. Harold, having to quickly march his army southward, met 
William's forces at the Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066. The battle was 
fierce and decisive. Harold was killed—traditionally said to be struck in the eye 
by an arrow—and his army was ultimately defeated. This victory effectively 
secured William's control over England.</p>
