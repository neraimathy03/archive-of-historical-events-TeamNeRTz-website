<p>The beginning of the Islamic calendar, known as the Hijri calendar, 
marks the year of the Hijra in 622 AD, when Prophet Muhammad and his followers 
migrated from Mecca to Medina. This event was pivotal in Islamic history as it 
signified the establishment of the first Muslim community. Facing severe 
persecution from the Quraysh tribe in Mecca, Muhammad sought a safe haven where 
his followers could freely practice their faith. The journey to Medina, 
approximately 320 kilometers away, was fraught with danger but ultimately 
successful. Upon arrival, Muhammad was welcomed by the local tribes, and the 
Muslim community, or ummah, was established. The Hijra was so significant that it 
became the starting point of the Islamic calendar, with the first year being 1 AH 
(Anno Hegirae). In Medina, Muhammad laid the foundations for governance with the 
Constitution of Medina, outlining the rights and duties of all residents, Muslim 
and non-Muslim alike. This migration not only consolidated the teachings of Islam 
but also set a precedent for the concept of an Islamic state. The Hijra is 
commemorated annually by Muslims during the Islamic New Year, serving as a 
reminder of the early sacrifices and the establishment of Islam as a structured 
and community-oriented faith. The Hijri calendar is still used today to determine 
the dates of important Islamic holidays, such as Ramadan, Hajj, and 
Eid.<br> <br>
The Hijra, which means "migration" in Arabic, occurred in 622 AD when 
Muhammad and approximately 70 of his followers left Mecca and traveled to Yathrib 
(later renamed Medina, meaning "the city of the Prophet"). This journey covered 
about 320 kilometers (200 miles) and was fraught with danger, as the Quraysh were 
determined to stop Muhammad's mission<br> <br>
The Hijra is commemorated annually by Muslims worldwide during the 
Islamic New Year, known as Ra's al-Sanah al-Hijriyah. This event serves as a 
reminder of the sacrifices made by the early Muslims and the establishment of 
Islam as a community-oriented faith.
The Hijri calendar continues to be used by Muslims for religious 
purposes.</p>
