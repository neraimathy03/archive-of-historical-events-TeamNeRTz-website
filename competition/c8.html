<h1>Start of the French Revolution (1789)</h1>

<p>The start of the French Revolution in 1789 was a pivotal event that 
profoundly reshaped France and had far-reaching effects on the global stage. The 
Revolution began with widespread discontent over social inequality, economic 
hardship, and an entrenched aristocratic privilege system. Key events leading to 
the Revolution include the financial crisis caused by France's involvement in 
costly wars, such as the American Revolution, and the extravagant spending of 
King Louis XVI and his court, which exacerbated the national debt and led to 
fiscal collapse.<br> <br>
In an attempt to resolve the financial crisis, Louis XVI convened the 
Estates-General in May 1789, a representative assembly comprising three estates: 
the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third 
Estate). However, the deeply entrenched inequities and the rigid class system led 
to an impasse. Frustrated by their lack of influence, the representatives of the 
Third Estate, who represented the vast majority of the French population, broke 
away and declared themselves the National Assembly on June 17, 1789, asserting 
their right to draft a new constitution. <br>  <br>
The Revolution's momentum increased on July 14, 1789, when Parisians 
stormed the Bastille, a medieval fortress and prison symbolizing the tyranny of 
the Bourbon monarchy. The fall of the Bastille became a powerful symbol of the 
people's uprising and the beginning of the end for the old regime. Following 
this, widespread unrest, known as the Great Fear, spread throughout the 
countryside, with peasants revolting against feudal landlords and burning records 
of their debts.<br>  <br>
In August 1789, the National Assembly adopted the Declaration of the 
Rights of Man and of the Citizen, a groundbreaking document that proclaimed the 
principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. It asserted the natural rights 
of individuals and the sovereignty of the people, laying the philosophical 
foundation for modern democratic governance. <br>  <br>
The early years of the French Revolution saw significant reforms, 
including the abolition of feudal privileges, the nationalization of church 
lands, and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. However, internal 
divisions, external threats from other monarchies, and radical factions within 
France led to escalating violence and political instability. This culminated in 
the rise of the radical Jacobins and the Reign of Terror, during which thousands, 
including King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, were executed.<br>  <br>
The Revolution fundamentally transformed French society by 
dismantling the feudal system, reducing the power of the monarchy and the church, 
and promoting secular and republican values. Its influence extended beyond 
France, inspiring revolutionary movements across Europe and the Americas and 
contributing to the spread of democratic ideals. <br>  <br>
The French Revolution, beginning in 1789, marks a critical juncture 
in world history, heralding the decline of absolute monarchies and the rise of 
modern nation-states founded on the principles of citizenship and inalienable 
rights.</p>
